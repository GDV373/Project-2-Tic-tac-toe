# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# UX
## User Stories
The idea is to make a twist on the original Tic-Tac-Toe game but using the iconic Charizard X and Charizard Y insted of the trditional X's and O's.  

## Strategy
The strategic aim is to create a site that can run this game on any web browser. 

## Scope
This version is intended to offer a quick fun 2 player game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Structure
The single page structure is built using  tooglescreen functions so that the user can progress from one point to another with out needing to go back or refreshing to keep playing.

## Skeleton (insert wirefames)

Before beginning development, a wireframe was mocked up. The idea behind the design was to keep the flow and structure consistent between the desktop and mobile versions while maintaining a similar layout. Because of this, distinct wireframes for each type of device were not made. This is a wireframe that shows the results message (post submission).  <br>

## Surface
The colour scheme is primarily limited to black text on a white page. The limited palette of this design and use of whitespace is intended to maximise simplicity, increase credibility and readability. The title and associated icon (together serving as a logo) is green as a visual reference to Ireland. The sans serif font (Roboto) was selected for its modernity, cleanliness and simplicity, to match the overall design. 

## Features
### Features included in this current version
Start screen menu to provide with what player 1 will start using as a character to play with, and a start button.
Game screen will start with a blank grid waiting for players to do their move's.
Depending on the result either a win screen for the player who connects 3 with their characters name will pop or a draw screen if no character manages to do any of the possible combinations for a win. Followed by a restart button to play again.
